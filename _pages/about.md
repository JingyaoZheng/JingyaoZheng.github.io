Hi! I am currently a PhD student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by [Dr. Lik-Hang Lee](https://www.lhlee.com). Before joining PolyU, I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). During my master's studies, I worked on my thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Per Ola Kristensson](https://pokristensson.com).
