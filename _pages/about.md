Hi! I am currently a PhD student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by [Dr.Lik Hang Lee](https://www.lhlee.com/). Before joining PolyU, I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). During my master's studies, I worked on my thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Per Ola Kristensson](https://pokristensson.com/).

My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction and Human Centered Artificial Intelligence. You can explore all my published articles on my [publication pages](/_pages/publications). If you share similar research interests or would like to collaborate with me, feel free to reach out to me via [email](info@jyzheng.com).
